# Pipe
Get-Commend | Where-Object {} | Sort-Object {} | Select-Object

# The && and || Operators
# The && operator executes the command to the right side of the pipe only if the first command was successful.

#  first command succeeds and the second command is executed
Write-Host "Primary Message" && Write-Host "Secondary Message"

# first command fails, the second is not executed
Write-Error "Primary Error" && Write-Host "Secondary Message"

# The || operator executes the command to the right side of the pipe only if the first command was unsuccessful. So itâ€™s the opposite of the previous one.

# first command succeeds, the second command is not executed
Write-Host "Primary Message" || Write-Host "Secondary Message"

# first command fails, so the second command is executed
Write-Error "Primary Error" || Write-Host "Secondary Message"


# Null-coalescing, assignment, and conditional operators
#PowerShell 7 includes Null coalescing operator ??, Null conditional assignment ??=, and Null conditional member access operators ?. and ?[]
